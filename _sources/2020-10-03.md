## Introduction



PySyft is a Python library for secure and private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples private data from model training, using
[Federated Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html),
[Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy),
and Encrypted Computation (like
[Multi-Party Computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)
and  [Homomorphic Encryption (HE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption))
within the main Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. Join the movement on
[Slack](http://slack.openmined.org/).

Great Expectations

*Always know what to expect from your data.*

Introduction

Great Expectations helps data teams eliminate pipeline debt, through data testing, documentation, and profiling.

Software developers have long known that testing and documentation are essential for managing complex codebases. Great Expectations brings the same confidence, integrity, and acceleration to data science and data engineering teams.

See [Down with Pipeline Debt!](https://medium.com/@expectgreatdata/down-with-pipeline-debt-introducing-great-expectations-862ddc46782a) for an introduction to the philosophy of pipeline testing.

## Jarvis


A Personal Assistant for Linux, MacOS and Windows


Jarvis is a simple personal assistant for Linux, MacOS and Windows which works on the command line. He can talk to you if you enable his voice. He can tell you the weather, he can find restaurants and other places near you. He can do some great stuff for you.

### Getting Started

In order to start Jarvis just clone [this repository](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis.git) and run `python installer`.

Run **Jarvis** from anywhere by command `jarvis`

On Mac OS X run `source setup.sh`

On Windows run `setup.bat`

You can start by typing `help` within the Jarvis command line to check what Jarvis can do for you.
