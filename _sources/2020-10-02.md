**Diagram as Code**.

Diagrams lets you draw the cloud system architecture **in Python code**. It was born for **prototyping** a new system architecture design without any design tools. You can also describe or visualize the existing system architecture as well. Diagrams currently supports main major providers including: `AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`, `Kubernetes`, `Alibaba Cloud`, `Oracle Cloud` etc... It also supports `On-Premise` nodes, `SaaS` and major `Programming` frameworks and languages.

**Diagram as Code** also allows you to **track** the architecture diagram changes in any **version control** system.

## Introduction



PySyft is a Python library for secure and private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples private data from model training, using
[Federated Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html),
[Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy),
and Encrypted Computation (like
[Multi-Party Computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)
and  [Homomorphic Encryption (HE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption))
within the main Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. Join the movement on

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles
configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning,
ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex
changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on `the Ansible website <https://ansible.com/>`_.

Design Principles

*  Have a dead-simple setup process with a minimal learning curve.
*  Manage machines very quickly and in parallel.
*  Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by
   leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
*  Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human
   friendly.
*  Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
*  Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any

## Continuous Security
We believe security scanning should be done continuously. Not daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly.

The benefit of running security scanning contiuously can be any of the following:
* You have a dynamic environment where infrastructure gets created every minute / hour / etc.
* You want to be the first to catch issues before anyone else
* You want the ability to respond quicker.

NERVE was created to address this problem. Commercial tools are great, but they are also heavy, ...

👉The C++ Core Guidelines are a set of tried-and-true guidelines, rules, and best practices about coding in C++  

😎TOPICS: ``  

⭐️STARS：28680, 今日上升数↑:18  

👉README：


>"Within C++ is a smaller, simpler, safer language struggling to get out."
>-- <cite>Bjarne Stroustrup</cite>

The [C++ Core Guidelines](CppCoreGuidelines.md) are a collaborative effort led by Bjarne Stroustrup, much like the C++ language itself. They are the result of many
person-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations. Their design encourages general applicability and broad adoption but
they can be freely copied and modified to meet your organization's needs.

### Getting started

The guidelines themselves are found at [CppCoreGuidelines](CppCoreGuidelines.md). The document is in [GH-flavored MarkDown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). It is intentionally kept simple, mostly in ASCII, to allow automatic post-processing such as language translation and reformatting. The editors maintain one
[version formatted for browsing](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines). Note that it is manually integrated and can be slightly older than the version in the master branch.

## Quick Start Guide

FinancePy can be installed from pip using the command:

To upgrade an existing installation type:

`pip install --upgrade financepy`

## Using FinancePy in a Jupyter Notebook

Once financepy has been installed, it is easy to get started.

Just download the project and examine the set of Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks folder.

A pdf manual describing all of the functions can be found in the project directory.

## Overview

FinancePy is a python-based library that is currently in beta version. It covers the following functionality:

* Valuation and risk models for a wide range of equity, FX, interest rate and credit derivatives.

Although it is written entirely in Python, it can achieve speeds comparable to C++ by using Numba. As a result the user has both the ability to examine the underlying code and the ability to perform pricing and risk at speeds which compare to a library written in C++.

The target audience for this library includes:

* Students wishing ...
