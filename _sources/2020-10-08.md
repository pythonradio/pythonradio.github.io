## Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET)

This repository contains the code for [Exploiting Cloze Questions for Few-Shot Text Classification and Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07676) and [It's Not Just Size That Matters: Small Language Models Are Also Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07118). The papers introduce pattern-exploiting training (PET), a semi-supervised training procedure that reformulates input examples as cloze-style phrases. In low-resource settings, PET and iPET significantly outperform regular supervised training, various semi-supervised baselines and even GPT-3 despite requiring 99.9% less parameters. The iterative variant of PET (iPET) trains multiple generations of models and can even be used without any training data.

**Status:** Maintenance (expect bug fixes and minor updates)

OpenAI Gym
**********

**OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.** This is the ``gym`` open-source library, which gives you access to a standardized set of environments.

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/openai/gym.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/openai/gym

`See What's New section below <#what-s-new>`_

``gym`` makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent, and is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano. You can use it from Python code, and soon from other languages.

If you're not sure where to start, we recommend beginning with the
`docs <https://gym.openai.com/docs>`_ on our site. See also the `FAQ <https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/FAQ>`_.

A whitepaper for OpenAI Gym is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540, and here's a BibTeX entry that you can use to cite it in a publication::

This project builds a self-driving RC car using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and open source software. Raspberry Pi collects inputs from a camera module and an ultrasonic sensor, and sends data to a computer wirelessly. The computer processes input images and sensor data for object detection (stop sign and traffic light) and collision avoidance respectively. A neural network model runs on computer and makes predictions for steering based on input images. Predictions are then sent to the Arduino for RC car control. 
  
#### Setting up environment with Anaconda
  1. Install [`miniconda(Python3)`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) on your computer
  2. Create `auto-rccar` environment with all necessary libraries for this project

Django

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "``docs``" directory and online at
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you read the docs:

* First, read ``docs/intro/install.txt`` for instructions on installing Django.

* Next, work through the tutorials in order (``docs/intro/tutorial01.txt``,
  ``docs/intro/tutorial02.txt``, etc.).

* If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read
  ``docs/howto/deployment/index.txt`` for instructions.

* You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in ``docs/topics``)
  next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in ``docs/howto``) for specific
  problems, and check out the reference (``docs/ref``) for gory details.

* See ``docs/README`` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or th...

## BERT

**\*\*\*\*\* New March 11th, 2020: Smaller BERT Models \*\*\*\*\***

This is a release of 24 smaller BERT models (English only, uncased, trained with WordPiece masking) referenced in [Well-Read Students Learn Better: On the Importance of Pre-training Compact Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962).

We have shown that the standard BERT recipe (including model architecture and training objective) is effective on a wide range of model sizes, beyond BERT-Base and BERT-Large. The smaller BERT models are intended for environments with restricted computational resources. They can be fine-tuned in the same manner as the original BERT models. However, they are most effective in the context of knowledge distillation, where the fine-tuning labels are produced by a larger and more accurate teacher.

Our goal is to enable research in institutions with fewer computational resources and encourage the community to seek directions of innovation alternative to increasing model capacity.

#### 一， Pytorch🔥  or TensorFlow2 🍎 

先说结论:

**如果是工程师，应该优先选TensorFlow2.**

**如果是学生或者研究人员，应该优先选择Pytorch.**

**如果时间足够，最好TensorFlow2和Pytorch都要学习掌握。**


理由如下：

* 1，**在工业界最重要的是模型落地，目前国内的大部分互联网企业只支持TensorFlow模型的在线部署，不支持Pytorch。** 并且工业界更加注重的是模型的高可用性，许多时候使用的都是成熟的模型架构，调试需求并不大。


* 2，**研究人员最重要的是快速迭代发表文章，需要尝试一些较新的模型架构。而Pytorch在易用性上相比TensorFlow2有一些优势，更加方便调试。** 并且在2019年以来在学术界占领了大半壁江山，能够找到的相应最新研究成果更多。


* 3，TensorFlow2和Pytorch实际上整体风格已经非常相似了，学会了其中一个，学习另外一个将比较容易。两种框架都掌握的话，能够参考的开源模型案例更多，并且可以方便地在两种框架之间切换。

## 🤩Python随身听-技术精选： /jantic/DeOldify
👉A Deep Learning based project for colorizing and restoring old images (and video!)  

😎TOPICS: ``

## DeOldify

**Quick Start**: The easiest way to colorize images using DeOldify (for free!) is here: [DeOldify Image Colorization on DeepAI](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/colorizer)

The **most advanced** version of DeOldify image colorization is available here, exclusively.  Try a few images for free! [MyHeritiage In Color](https://www.myheritage.com/incolor)

**NEW** Having trouble with the default image colorizer, aka "artistic"?  Try the "stable" one below.  It generally won't produce colors that are as interesting as "artistic", but the glitches are noticeably reduced.

## Encoding in Style: a StyleGAN Encoder for Image-to-Image Translation

> We present a generic image-to-image translation framework, Pixel2Style2Pixel (pSp). Our pSp framework is based on a novel encoder network that directly generates a series of style vectors which are fed into a pretrained StyleGAN generator, forming the extended W+ latent space. We first show that our encoder can directly embed real images into W+, with no additional optimization. We further introduce a dedicated identity loss which is shown to achieve improved performance in the reconstruction of an input image. We demonstrate pSp to be a simple architecture that, by leveraging a well-trained, fixed generator network, can be easily applied on a wide-range of image-to-image translation tasks. Solving these t...
