### ⚠️ Warning
- **02/10/2020** : Since few days ago, Google return a 404 when we try to access someone's Google Photos public albums, we can only access it if we have a link of one of his albums.\
Either this is a bug and this will be fixed, either it's a protection that we need to find how to bypass.\
**So, currently, the photos & metadata module will always return "No albums" even if there is one.**

⭐️STARS：10033, 今日上升数↑:14  

👉README：

## DeepCreamPy
*Decensoring Hentai with Deep Neural Networks.*


A deep learning-based tool to automatically replace censored artwork in hentai with plausible reconstructions.

Before DeepCreamPy can be used, the user must color censored regions in their hentai green with an image editing program like GIMP or Photoshop. DeepCreamPy takes the green colored images as input, and a neural network automatically fills in the censored regions.

You can download the latest release for Windows 64-bit [here](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/releases/latest). 

For users interested in compiling DeepCreamPy themselves, DeepCreamPy can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Please before you open a new issue check [closed issues](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and check the [table of contents](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy#table-of-contents).

## Welcome to Archai

Archai is a platform for Neural Network Search (NAS) that allow you to generate efficient deep networks for your applications. Archai aspires to accelerate NAS research by enabling easy mix and match between different techniques while ensuring reproducibility, self-documented hyper-parameters and fair comparison. To achieve this, Archai uses common code base that unifies several algorithms. Archai is extensible and modular to allow rapid experimentation of new research ideas and develop new NAS algorithms. Archai also hopes to make NAS research more accessible to non-experts by providing powerful configuration system and easy to use tools.

[Extensive feature list](docs/features.md)

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Archai requires Python 3.6+ and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 1.2+. To install Python we highly recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads). Archai works both on Linux as well as Windows.

We believe security scanning should be done continuously. Not daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly.

The benefit of running security scanning contiuously can be any of the following:
* You have a dynamic environment where infrastructure gets created every minute / hour / etc.
* You want to be the first to catch issues before anyone else
* You want the ability to respond quicker.

This project builds a self-driving RC car using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and open source software. Raspberry Pi collects inputs from a camera module and an ultrasonic sensor, and sends data to a computer wirelessly. The computer processes input images and sensor data for object detection (stop sign and traffic light) and collision avoidance respectively. A neural network model runs on computer and makes predictions for steering based on input images. Predictions are then sent to the Arduino for RC car control.

## AutoEQ
**TL;DR** If you are here just looking to make your headphones sound better, find your headphone model in
[results](./results) folder's recommended headphones list
and follow instructions in [Usage](#usage) section. 

### About This Project
AutoEQ is a project for equalizing headphone frequency responses automatically and it achieves this by parsing
frequency response measurements and producing equalization settings which correct the headphone to a neutral sound.
This project currently has over 2500 headphones covered in the
[results](./results) folder.
See [Usage](#usage) for instructions how to use the results with
different equalizer softwares and
[Results](#results) section for details about parameters and how the results were
obtained.

AutoEQ is not just a collection of automatically produced headphone equalization settings but also a tool for equalizing
headphones for yourself. `autoeq.py` provides methods for reading data, equalizing it to a given target
response and saving the results for u...

This repository contains all of the code and software labs for [MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com)! All lecture slides and videos are available on the course website.


### Opening the labs in Google Colaboratory:

The 2020 6.S191 labs will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, you don't need to download anything. To run these labs, you must have a Google account.

On this Github repo, navigate to the lab folder you want to run (`lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`) and open the appropriate python notebook (\*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the lab. That's it!

### Running the labs
Now, to run the labs, open the Jupyter notebook on Colab. Navigate to the "Runtime" tab --> "Change runtime type". In the pop-up window, under "Runtime type" select "Python 3", and under "Hardware accelerator" select "GPU". Go through the notebooks and fill in the `#TODO` cells to get the code to compile for yourself!

**Important**: This documentation covers fastai v2, which is a from-scratch rewrite of fastai. The v1 documentation has moved to [fastai1.fast.ai](https://fastai1.fast.ai). To stop fastai from updating to v2, run in your terminal `echo 'fastai 1.*' >> $CONDA_PREFIX/conda-meta/pinned` (if you use conda).


### Installing

You can use fastai without any installation by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). In fact, every page of this documentation is also available as an interactive notebook - click "Open in colab" at the top of any page to open it (be sure to change the Colab runtime to "GPU" to have it run fast!) See the fast.ai course [Introduction to Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for more information.

You can install fastai on your own machines with conda (highly recommended). If you're using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) then run:

## Course Description

Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can handle tabular data, images, text, and audio as both input and output. Deep learning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is like the function of the human brain. This course will introduce the student to classic neural network structures, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recur...
